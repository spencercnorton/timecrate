# Quarterly boot-and-verify capstone: a REAL wiped-OS recovery, inside a real booted VM.
#
# This is deliberately not a CI job. CI runners are containers and cannot nest a multipass VM,
# and the thing under test is precisely what a container cannot model: a machine that
# boots, runs systemd and dbus, installs packages from restored apt sources, and keeps the restored
# configuration across a reboot. So it runs where the hardware is — beside the drill, on a timer.
#
# What it proves that the monthly drill does NOT: the drill decrypts and authenticates a kit. This
# rebuilds from one. Between v1.3.0 and v2.8.0 the drill stayed green for twelve releases while the
# documented package replay was silently broken — one selected package with an unavailable i386
# dependency made apt refuse the ENTIRE transaction, so a rebuilt box would restore every file and
# install none of ~3000 packages. Nothing short of this test could see that.
#
# DESIGN RULE, learned the hard way in this very script: verify EFFECTS, never exit codes. The
# first cut chained `transfer A || transfer B || fail`; A pointed at a path that did not exist,
# returned zero anyway, and so the fallback never ran, the guard never fired, and the run died
# inside the VM with "No such file or directory". Every step below asserts the thing it wanted to
# happen actually happened.
#
#   --preflight   check every prerequisite and exit, WITHOUT launching a VM. This is what the
#                 regression suite runs, and what to run by hand after changing anything here.
#
# TIMECRATE_CAPSTONE_SYSCTL (space-separated sysctl keys, optional): after the reboot, each must
# be in effect with the value the restored /etc/sysctl.d sets -- proof that restored configuration
# is applied, not merely present. Without it the check is that every restored file and a marker
# survive the reboot.
