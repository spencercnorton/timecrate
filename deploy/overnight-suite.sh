# Overnight assurance run. Answers the questions the per-commit suite structurally cannot, because
# they need the real remote, real kits and real booted machines:
#
#   T1  every kit on the remote decrypts, authenticates and lists — not just the newest
#   T2  a rebuild from the OLDEST kit, which GFS retention means was often written by an older
#       version of this tool. That is the actual fallback when the newest kit is the suspect one.
#   T3  three consecutive capstone runs, because "it passed once" is not "it is dependable on a
#       timer" — VM orchestration is exactly where flakiness hides
#   T4  the GUI against the REAL engine and the REAL remote. Until now it has only ever been
#       smoke-tested against a stub CLI, so every assertion about it has been about the stub.
#   T5  the alert path end to end, since T1-T4 running unattended are worthless if a failure
#       cannot reach anyone
#
# SAFETY, because this runs while nobody is watching:
#   * READ-ONLY against the remote. It never uploads, never prunes, never writes a kit.
#   * Finishes before the nightly backup. The engine holds a flock, so an overrun would make the
#     BACKUP fail — the one outcome that must never be caused by a test.
#   * Every VM is destroyed and every staged copy of the escrowed key is shredded, with the same
#     proven-teardown logic as the capstone: re-checked, retried, and reported if it survives.
#   * Per-test timeouts, so one hang cannot consume the night.
